# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-OF-COVID19-PANDEMIC
ANALYZING SENTIMENT AND EMOTIONAL IMPLICATIONS IN PANDEMIC-RELATED TWEETS 
# INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in significant adverse consequences on emotional well-being and unforeseen shifts in daily life. Amidst the global health crisis, countless individuals found themselves confined within their homes, leading to intensified emotional states. Social media emerged as a pivotal lifeline during this period, providing a means for users to connect with loved ones, share their thoughts and sentiments, and seek support. However, altered relationships often gave rise to feelings of solitude and isolation, creating a sense of detachment due to physical separation from friends, family, and the larger community. This phenomenon contributed to a surge in emotional challenges such as despair and anxiety. Recognizing and addressing the psychological repercussions of COVID-19 is of paramount importance, as studies have indicated a notable increase in the prevalence of depression and other emotional disorders during the pandemic. The extensive textual data generated by social media platforms presents a unique opportunity to gain insights into the prevailing sentiments and emotions experienced by individuals throughout the pandemic. In this context, sentiment analysis emerges as a valuable approach for comprehending the emotional well-being of people during the pandemic. This methodology holds the potential to identify prevalent emotional states, pinpoint most prevalent tweets, and uncover the challenges faced by diverse demographic groups through an analysis of sentiments expressed in individuals' social media posts.
# ANALYSIS AIM
The primary goal of this study is to leverage sentiment analysis to discern the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and establish a comprehensive framework that enhances the understanding of the worldwide emotional implications during a crisis. This analysis will encompass a global perspective, enabling us to draw significant insights that can inform the development of targeted healthcare policies and support initiatives tailored to address the mental health repercussions of the pandemic. Through this endeavor, we aim to contribute valuable insights that serve as a guiding compass for the development of informed decision-making and facilitate the design of effective interventions to challenges arising from the pandemic.
# FEATURE EXTRACTION PROCESS
Feature extraction aims to extract relevant information from the text and represent in a way that can be quantitatively analysed. By using these methods, the features are extracted from the text or sentences, to enable accurate opinion analysis.

•	**Noise Removal for Textual Data** – This involves cleaning and preparing text to remove extraneous or irrelevant information, hence improving the data suitability for activities like modelling, analysis, or other natural language processing. Typographical errors, special characters, incorrect punctuation, irregular capitalization, and even unrelated words or phrases are all examples of noise in textual data.

•	**Lemmatization** – This method breaks down words into their fundamental or root forms. It decreases the number of distinct words while preserving their meaning. The text may therefore be represented in a more condensed and insightful manner as a result.

•	**Encoding Sentiments**: To ensure effective training of machine learning models, sentiment labels like "positive" and "negative" are converted into numerical values through the utilization of one-hot encoding. This transformation simplifies the process of training and assessing sentiment analysis models.

•	**Crafting Feature Vectors**: Feature vectors serve as numerical interpretations of processed text. Within the realm of machine learning, feature vectors hold significant value as they enable machine learning models to process textual information as numerical data. Among various techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) stands out as a widely used method for transforming text data into a format that suits machine learning algorithms. 
# POLARITY IMPLEMENTATION FLOWCHART

• **LEXICON BASED APPROACH** - A lexicon is a collection of words or phrases with the attribute that best compliment them. This collection of words is known as token. A precomputed sentiment score is applied to each word or phrase. This rating represents the word's sentimental polarity, which can be either good, negative, or neutral. The word "happy" might be given a positive sentiment score, whilst the word "sad" might be given a negative emotion value. The text is analysed by breaking it down into tokens and finding these tokens up in the sentiment lexicon to assign sentiment scores when performing sentiment analysis using a lexicon-based technique. The analysis utilized Vader and Sentiwordnet method in assigning polarity to the sentiments in the text.

•	**VADER**- Vader stands for "Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner." It is a tool for sentiment analysis that uses a lexicon-based approach to analyze and quantify the emotions represented in text sources. Social media text, informal language, and brief messages like tweets are especially well-suited for this approach.

•	**SENTIWORDNET** - This sentiment analysis approach uses a lexical tool called WordNet. This approach accomplishes word sense disambiguation through different ways the word can be used and how it's related to other words, ensuring precise sentiment score assignment.

# MODEL IMPLEMENTATION FLOWCHART

The machine learning approach was applied on the data which has been labelled from the lexicon-based approach to enable prediction. This involves leveraging the power of advanced algorithms to analyse and learn patterns from the lexicon-labelled data, enabling the model to predict sentiment labels for new or unseen text. A thorough and precise sentiment analysis framework was created using both lexicon-based labelling and machine learning methods.

•	**Multinomial Naïve Bayes** – This is a probabilistic kind of classification algorithm which is mostly used for classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis. This algorithm is an extension of the naïve bayes model which deals with discrete data by determining the likelihood of each class given the characteristics (words) in a text to categorize it. 

•	**Logistic Regression** – Logistic regression is a statistical procedure for binary and multiple class classification tasks. Despite its name, it is mainly used for classification rather than regression. This is a machine learning technique that is particularly suited for analysis where the dependent variable is categorical. The sigmoid function is used in logistic regression to represent the likelihood that the input data will fall into a particular class.

•	**XGBoost** - Extreme Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines the prediction of multiple models to increase its overall performance. The model builds an ensemble of weak learners (usually decision trees) in an iterative manner. Each new tree is trained to correct the errors of the previous trees. It optimizes a loss function by changing the parameters (weights) of the weak learners and uses gradient descent to find the best parameters that minimize the loss.

# EVALUATION METRICS
To assess a classification model's capacity to accurately predict positive instances while reducing false positives and false negatives, the F1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy are crucial metrics. The analysis employed these classification reports in checking the accuracy of the models.

# CONCLUSION
The analysis focused on emotional instability, particularly in the context of ongoing challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. It revealed that emotional instability persists even after crises like the pandemic. Through sentiment analysis of pandemic-related tweets, the results provided concrete evidence of the global emotional impact of the epidemic. It contributes to a deeper understanding of how global crises affect individuals' psychological well-being by quantifying and visualizing sentiment dynamics. This suggests the importance of integrating sentiment analysis into decision-making processes for government bodies, policymakers, and organizations.
